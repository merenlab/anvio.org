When using WSL, you need to add `-I localhost` to any interactive interface commands. 

Here is an example with `anvi-interactive`:
```
anvi-interactive -c CONTIGS.db -p MERGED/PROFILE.db -I localhost
```
The link for the interactive interface should look like this (with default port):
```
http://localhost:8080
```
