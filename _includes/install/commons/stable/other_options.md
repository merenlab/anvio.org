You will always find the official archives of anvi'o code as at the bottom of our GitHub releases as `anvio-X.tar.gz`:

The best way to see what additional software you will need running on your computer for anvi'o to be happy is to take a look at the contents of [this conda recipe](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/blob/master/conda-recipe/anvio/meta.yaml) (which is a conda build recipe, but it will give you the idea (ignore anvio-minimal, you basically have that one taken care of when you have anvi'o installed)).

Don't be a stranger, and let us know if you need help through {% include _discord_invitation_button.html %}.
