Now you are in a pristine environment, in which you will install all conda packages that anvi'o will need to work properly. This looks scary, but it will work if you just copy-paste it and press ENTER:

{% include install/conda_command.md %}

If you see any error messages in the output indicating that a package failed to install, you should check the 'Common problems' section below or search for it in the [anvi'o issues page](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/issues) (make sure to check the 'Closed' issues as well) to see if we already found a solution for the error.
