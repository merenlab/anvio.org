This section is not quite meant to be followed by those who would define themselves as *end users* in a conventional sense. But we are not the kinds of people who would dare to tell anyone what they can and cannot do. FWIW, our experience suggests that if you are doing microbiology, you will do computers no problem if you find dem computers exciting.

If you follow these steps, you will have anvi'o setup on your system in such a way, every time you initialize your anvi'o environment you will get **the very final state of the anvi'o code**. Plus, you can have both the stable and active anvi'o on the same computer.

Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that there are multiple advantages and disadvantages to working with the active development branch. Advantages are obvious and include,

* **Full access to all new features and bug fixes in real-time**, without having to wait for stable releases to be announced.

* A working system to **hack anvi'o and/or add new features to the code** (this strategy is exactly how we develop anvi'o and use it for our science at the same time at our lab).

In contrast, disadvantages include,

* **Unstable intermediate states may frustrate you with bugs, and in extremely rare instances loss of data** (this happened only once so far during the last five years, and required one of our users to re-generate their contigs databases).

* Difficulty to mention the anvi'o version in a paper. Although this can easily be solved by sharing not the version number of anvi'o but the cryptographic hash of the last commit for reproducibility. If you ever struggle with this, please let us know and we will help you.

If you are still here, let's start.
