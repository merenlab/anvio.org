This page describes the anvi'o installation process for _personal computers running a Linux operating system_.

## (1) Things you need before you start

You will need to run the installation commands from a terminal. Since you are using Linux, you should be good to go. :) 

You also need [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to be installed on your system. If you don't already have it, please follow their installation instructions.
