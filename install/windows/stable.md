This page describes the anvi'o installation process for the current stable release on _Microsoft Windows_.

## (1) Things you need before you start

{% include install/windows/things_you_need.md %}

{:.warning}
If the WSL installation fails with an error that looks like this: `WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x80070032`. Then you could try the following solution: Open the Start menu and search for 'Turn Windows Features On or Off'. In the resulting pop-up box, click the checkboxes to activate "Windows Subsystem for Linux" and "Virtual Machine Platform". Then try the WSL installation again.

## (2) Set up conda

{:.notice}
Anvi'o will only run inside the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux, see above). If you prompt includes something like "C:\Users" you are inside the Windows Powershell (not WSL). From powershell type `wsl` to open your Linux subsystem.
To ensure you are inside the WS, type `uname` (should print "Linux").
