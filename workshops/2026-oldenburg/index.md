We are planning a free, in-person workshop and early-career researcher symposium to discuss integrated microbial 'omics and learn how to use anvi'o. The topics that we will cover during the workshop include,

* Genomics
* Metagenomics
* Genome-resolved metagenomics
* Microbial metabolism
* Pangenomics
* Phylogenomics

If you are interested in attending, please consider applying as soon as possible as we have limited number of seats in the workshop venue, and mark your calendars for April 13-17, 2026.

Do you know someone who may be interested in attending? Please feel free to share this page with them!

Please find photos and the outcomes of a [previous iteration](https://anvio.org/workshops/2025-oldenburg/) of the same workshop [here](https://anvio.org/blog/oldenburg-25-anvio-workshop/).

{:.warning}
**An important note on funding.** While the workshop itself is free (with lunch and coffee provided), we unfortunately do not have the funds to cover travel and accommodation costs for participants. That said, _we are currently seeking funds to support the travel needs of at least some participants who may not be able to attend the event without it_. Thus, we strongly encourage applications from institutions with limited resources around the globe. Please indicate in your application if you will need travel support. If we are able to acquire funding, we will likely be able to support a few of these applications. Feel free to write to any of us if you have any questions.

{:.warning}
Please remember that the **application deadline is on Dec 10, 2025**.
