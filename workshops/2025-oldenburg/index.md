We are planning a free, in-person workshop and early-career researcher symposium to discuss integrated microbial 'omics and learn how to use anvi'o. The topics that we will cover during the workshop include,

* Genomics
* Metagenomics
* Genome-resolved metagenomics
* Pangenomics
* Phylogenomics
* Microbial population genetics

If you are interested in attending, please consider applying as soon as possible as we have limited number of seats in the workshop venue, and mark your calendars for March 3-7 2025.

Please feel free to share this page with anyone who may benefit from this workshop, and please note that we will cover travel and accommodation (as long as our funds last), so we strongly encourage applications from institutions with limited resources around the globe.

Feel free to write to any of us if you have any questions.

{:.warning}
The **application deadline was on Jan 10, 2025** and we are no longer accepting new applications.
