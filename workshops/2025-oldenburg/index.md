We are planning a free, in-person workshop and early-career researcher symposium to discuss integrated microbial 'omics and learn how to use anvi'o. The topics that we will cover during the workshop include,

* Genomics
* Metagenomics
* Genome-resolved metagenomics
* Pangenomics
* Phylogenomics

If you are interested in attending, please consider [apply](https://forms.gle/kzFJN1ozG9p4f2j39)ing as soon as possible as we have limited number of seats in the workshop venue, and mark your calendars for March 3-7 2025.

Please feel free to share this page with anyone who may benefit from this workshop, and please note that we will cover travel and accommodation (as long as our funds last), so we strongly encourage applications from institutions with limited resources around the globe.

Feel free to write to any of us if you have any questions.

## Program

In addition to intense hands-on training sessions, this event includes an ECR symposium, during which all of the participants will give lightning talks about their research. We will send the details of lightning talks to each participant upon their invitation.

Here is a very preliminary overview of the workshop content:

9:00 - 12:00 | Introduction to anvi'o software ecosystem
13:00 - 13:45 | Symposium talks
14:00 - 17:00 | Basics of genomics: gene calling, functional annotations, taxonomy estimation

#### Tuesday 4: Metabolic reconstruction + Pangenomics

9:00 - 12:00 | Metabolic reconstruction and functional enrichment analyses
13:00 - 13:45 | Symposium talks
14:00 - 17:00 | Introduction to pangenomics

#### Wednesday 5: Pangenomics - Pangenome graph - Phylogenomics

9:00 - 12:00 | Pangenomics and pangenome graphs
13:00 - 13:45 | Symposium talks
14:00 - 17:00 | Phylogenomics

#### Thursday 6: Metagenomics

9:00 - 12:00 | Metagenomic read recruitment
13:00 - 13:45 | Symposium talks
14:00 - 17:00 | Genome resolved metagenomics: binning and refinement

#### Friday 7: Analysis workflow

9:00 - 12:00 | Population genetics
13:00 - 13:45 | Symposium talks
14:00 - 17:00 | Using automated workflows to scale up your analysis

## How much does it cost?

We will cover your lunches and coffee/tea breaks. Travel support and accommodation is available upon request while the funds last. The rest is up to you.
