## Description

A genes database is a <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/help/7/artifacts/profile-db)</span> that also contains all of the gene-level statistics (such as coverage and detection). This is the output of the program <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-gen-gene-level-stats-databases](/help/7/programs/anvi-gen-gene-level-stats-databases)</span>, which will generate one of these per <span class="artifact-n">[bin](/help/7/artifacts/bin)</span> in the <span class="artifact-n">[collection](/help/7/artifacts/collection)</span> you input. 

As such, you can use this as an input anywhere a <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/help/7/artifacts/profile-db)</span> is asked for. See that page for more information.
