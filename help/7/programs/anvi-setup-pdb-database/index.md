Setup or update an offline database of representative PDB structures clustered at 95%.

Go back to the **[main page](../../)** of anvi'o programs and artifacts.

## Usage



## Basic usage 

This program creates a <span class="artifact-n">[pdb-db](/help/7/artifacts/pdb-db)</span> local database that holds PDB structures from [this sequence database](https://salilab.org/modeller/supplemental.html), which is hosted by the [Sali lab](https://salilab.org/).  Their database comprises all PDB RCSB sequences that have been clustered at 95% sequence similarity. They seem to update their database every couple of months (thank you guys!).


The purpose of <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-setup-pdb-database](/help/7/programs/anvi-setup-pdb-database)</span> to have a local copy of reference structures that can be used to, for example, get template structures for homology modelling when <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-gen-structure-database](/help/7/programs/anvi-gen-structure-database)</span> is ran.


Running this program is easy:

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;setup&#45;pdb&#45;database &#45;&#45;just&#45;do&#45;it
</div>

If you already have a <span class="artifact-n">[pdb-db](/help/7/artifacts/pdb-db)</span> artifact and are trying to redownload this data, run 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;setup&#45;pdb&#45;database &#45;&#45;reset
</div>

Or if you just want to update your database, run 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;setup&#45;pdb&#45;database &#45;&#45;update
</div>

## Notes

The output <span class="artifact-n">[pdb-db](/help/7/artifacts/pdb-db)</span> database is ~20GB and its contents may take several hours to download.
