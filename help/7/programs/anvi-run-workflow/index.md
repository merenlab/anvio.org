Execute, manage, parallelize, and troubleshoot entire &#x27;omics workflows and chain together anvi&#x27;o and third party programs.

Go back to the **[main page](../../)** of anvi'o programs and artifacts.

## Usage


This program allows you to run [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflows for common anvi'o processes. It is described fully in [this tutorial](https://merenlab.org/2018/07/09/anvio-snakemake-workflows/#contigs-workflow). 

Essentially, an anvi'o workflow will run several anvi'o programs for you in quick succession (based on a standard set of intiial steps that will allow you to quickly get to a point where you can ask novel questions). 

As of now, the available workflows are the <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-workflow](/help/7/artifacts/contigs-workflow)</span>, the <span class="artifact-n">[metagenomics-workflow](/help/7/artifacts/metagenomics-workflow)</span>, the <span class="artifact-n">[pangenomics-workflow](/help/7/artifacts/pangenomics-workflow)</span>, the <span class="artifact-n">[phylogenomics-workflow](/help/7/artifacts/phylogenomics-workflow)</span>, and the <span class="artifact-n">[trnaseq-workflow](/help/7/artifacts/trnaseq-workflow)</span>. 

### Before running the workflow

Each workflow requires a <span class="artifact-n">[workflow-config](/help/7/artifacts/workflow-config)</span>: the file that details all of the parameters for the workflow. To get the <span class="artifact-n">[workflow-config](/help/7/artifacts/workflow-config)</span> with the default parameters, just run 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;run&#45;workflow &#45;w WORKFLOW&#45;NAME \
                  &#45;&#45;get&#45;default&#45;config CONFIG.json
</div>

Before running a workflow, it is also a good idea to check the required dependencies by running 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;run&#45;workflow &#45;w WORKFLOW&#45;NAME \
                  &#45;&#45;list&#45;dependencies
</div>

### The main run 

The main run of the workflow should look like this: 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;run&#45;workflow &#45;w WORKFLOW&#45;NAME \
                  &#45;c CONFIG.json
                  &#45;&#45;save&#45;workflow&#45;graph
</div>

The flag `--save-workflow-graph` creates a visual representation of the anvio programs that the workflow you're running used. 

You can also use the `-A` flag at the end of the parameter list to change other [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) parameters.
