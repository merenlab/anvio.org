## Usage


This program, as implied by the name, is used to delete a <span class="artifact-n">[collection](/help/7/artifacts/collection)</span> from a <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/help/7/artifacts/profile-db)</span>. 

When you do this, you'll lose the collection forever, as well as the <span class="artifact-n">[bin](/help/7/artifacts/bin)</span>s within it. It is generally a good idea to export your binning effort into a <span class="artifact-n">[collection-txt](/help/7/artifacts/collection-txt)</span> using <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-export-collection](/help/7/programs/anvi-export-collection)</span> before deleting it, just to be safe. 

To list available collections in a database, call 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;delete&#45;collection &#45;p <span class="artifact&#45;n">[profile&#45;db](/help/7/artifacts/profile&#45;db)</span> \
                       &#45;&#45;list&#45;collections
</div>

Then, you can easily delete a collection with the command

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;delete&#45;collection &#45;p <span class="artifact&#45;n">[profile&#45;db](/help/7/artifacts/profile&#45;db)</span> \
                       &#45;C <span class="artifact&#45;n">[collection](/help/7/artifacts/collection)</span>
</div>
