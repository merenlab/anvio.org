Import an external binning result into anvi&#x27;o.

Go back to the **[main page](../../)** of anvi'o programs and artifacts.

{% capture network_path %}{{ "network.json" }}{% endcapture %}

## Usage


This program, as one might think, allows you to import a <span class="artifact-n">[collection](/help/7/artifacts/collection)</span>. This allows you to easily import any binning that you've already done into a <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/help/7/artifacts/profile-db)</span>, since the <span class="artifact-n">[bin](/help/7/artifacts/bin)</span>s within that collection will be carried over. 

This information (in the form of a <span class="artifact-n">[collection-txt](/help/7/artifacts/collection-txt)</span>) can either come from another Anvi'o project (using <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-export-collection](/help/7/programs/anvi-export-collection)</span>) or you can get the coverage and sequence composion of your data using <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-export-splits-and-coverages](/help/7/programs/anvi-export-splits-and-coverages)</span> to bin your contigs with software outside of Anvi'o, then import that data into your database with this program. 

You can run this program like so: 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;import&#45;collection &#45;C my_bins.txt \
                        &#45;p <span class="artifact&#45;n">[profile&#45;db](/help/7/artifacts/profile&#45;db)</span> \
                        &#45;c <span class="artifact&#45;n">[contigs&#45;db](/help/7/artifacts/contigs&#45;db)</span> 
</div>

This will import the collection indicated in `my_bins.txt` into your <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/help/7/artifacts/profile-db)</span>. 

`my_bins.txt` should be a tab-delimited file where the first column lists a split name and the second lists the bin that it is placed in. You can see an example of this [here](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/blob/master/anvio/tests/sandbox/example_files_for_external_binning_results/external_binning_of_splits.txt). 

You can also provide this information by listing your contigs instead of your splits (like [this](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/blob/master/anvio/tests/sandbox/example_files_for_external_binning_results/external_binning_of_contigs.txt)). Just add the `--contigs-mode` tag. 

You can also provide an information file to describe the source and/or colors of your bins. [This file](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/blob/master/anvio/tests/sandbox/example_files_for_external_binning_results/example_bins_info_file.txt) is an example of such an information file.
