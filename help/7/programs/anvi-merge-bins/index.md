## Usage


This program **merges two or more <span class="artifact-n">[bin](/help/7/artifacts/bin)</span>s together** into a single <span class="artifact-n">[bin](/help/7/artifacts/bin)</span>.

To run this program, the bins that you want to merge must be contained within a single <span class="artifact-n">[collection](/help/7/artifacts/collection)</span>. Just provide the collection name, the <span class="artifact-n">[pan-db](/help/7/artifacts/pan-db)</span> or <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/help/7/artifacts/profile-db)</span> you're working with, the bins that you want to merge, and the name of the output bin. 

To check what collections and bins are contained in a database, you can either run this program with the flag `--list-collections` or `--list-bins`, or you can run <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-show-collections-and-bins](/help/7/programs/anvi-show-collections-and-bins)</span>.

For example, if you wanted to merge the bins `first_third`, `middle_third`, and `last_third` in a pan-db into a single bin called `complete_bin`, just run 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;merge&#45;bins &#45;p <span class="artifact&#45;n">[pan&#45;db](/help/7/artifacts/pan&#45;db)</span> \
                &#45;C <span class="artifact&#45;n">[collection](/help/7/artifacts/collection)</span> \
                &#45;b first_third,middle_third,last_third \
                &#45;B complete_bin
</div>

Now your collection will contain the bin `complete_bin` and the original bins will be gone forever (unless you had run<span class="artifact-n">[anvi-summarize](/help/7/programs/anvi-summarize)</span>, <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-export-collection](/help/7/programs/anvi-export-collection)</span>, or a similar program beforehand)
