## Usage


This program, as implied by the name, is used to delete a <span class="artifact-n">[hmm-hits](/help/7/artifacts/hmm-hits)</span> from a <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/help/7/artifacts/contigs-db)</span>. This way, you can repopulate the function annotations with a different source or program or just delete data that's clogging up the interface.

It is generally a good idea to export your information before deleting it, just in case. The HMM hits will show up in most displays, so if you've already run <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-summarize](/help/7/programs/anvi-summarize)</span>, you should be good. 

To list available <span class="artifact-n">[hmm-source](/help/7/artifacts/hmm-source)</span>s in a database, call 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;delete&#45;hmms &#45;c <span class="artifact&#45;n">[contigs&#45;db](/help/7/artifacts/contigs&#45;db)</span> \
                 &#45;&#45;list&#45;hmm&#45;sources
</div>

Then, you can easily delete <span class="artifact-n">[hmm-hits](/help/7/artifacts/hmm-hits)</span> from a specific source with the command

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;delete&#45;hmms &#45;c <span class="artifact&#45;n">[contigs&#45;db](/help/7/artifacts/contigs&#45;db)</span> \
                 &#45;&#45;hmm&#45;source <span class="artifact&#45;n">[hmm&#45;source](/help/7/artifacts/hmm&#45;source)</span> 
</div>
