## Description

This is a text file containing **the detection value for each gene in each sample** that was in the <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/help/8/artifacts/profile-db)</span> and <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/help/8/artifacts/contigs-db)</span> that you used when you ran  <span class="artifact-p">[anvi-export-gene-coverage-and-detection](/help/8/programs/anvi-export-gene-coverage-and-detection)</span>. 

This is a tab-delimited file where each row describes a specific gene and each column describes one of your samples. Each cell contains the detection of that gene in that sample.
