The workshop took place in the new building of [HIFMB](https://hifmb.de), 

{% include IMAGE path="/images/workshops/2025-oldenburg/anvio-workshop-01.jpg" width=100 %}

There were over 30 participants from 19 countries in the workshop, and in addition to that, we were lucky to have many of our colleagues from neighboring institutions in the region such as the [Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment (ICBM)](https://uol.de/en/icbm), [MPI for Marine Microbiology](https://www.mpi-bremen.de/), and the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/).

{% include IMAGE path="/images/workshops/2025-oldenburg/anvio-workshop-02.jpg" width=100 %}

{% include person/display_mini_single.html github="ivagljiva" %} and {% include person/display_mini_single.html github="FlorianTrigodet" %} masterfully organized everything, and delivered the vast majority of lectures and tutorials.

{% include IMAGE path="/images/workshops/2025-oldenburg/anvio-workshop-03.jpg" width=100 %}

And the new conference room in the freshly built HIFMB facility passed its first test through a multi-day intense computational workshop by being able to provide its participants with *electricity* through the power outlets on the floor, a *massive display* bright enough to rival the Sun, *internet* which admittedly had its occasional hiccups, and of course ample amounts of *fresh air* through the large balcony door (while its definition may be elusive, the concept of fresh air is a big thing in Germany and we must all welcome it regardless of the temperature differences between you and the outside where fresh air lives its best life).

All things considered, I would rate the room a solid 7.7 out of 10. With slightly better sound and a more reliable internet connection, it will hopefully be perfect for years to come.

During the breaks everyone went out to enjoy tea, coffee, and light snacks while catching up with one another.

{% include IMAGE path="/images/workshops/2025-oldenburg/anvio-workshop-07.jpg" width=100 %}

But there were no breaks for the organizers and faculty since there was always something more to discuss or one more technical issue to address.

{% include IMAGE path="/images/workshops/2025-oldenburg/anvio-workshop-05.jpg" width=100 %}

That's how workshops were, and *everything was beautiful and nothing hurt*.

{% include IMAGE path="/images/workshops/2025-oldenburg/anvio-workshop-06.jpg" width=100 %}

I liked the image above so much that I called upon an old friend, Reginald Fairhurst, to write his thoughts on it for all of us to read. Reggie is a 77-year-old critic who spends most of his time in his tiny London apartment, typing away on a 1947 Royal Quiet Deluxe, writing about his qualms and frustrations with contemporary art, especially photography:

> With electrifying intensity, this photograph masterfully captures the spectrum of human engagement within a fleeting moment of a dynamic workshop. While the unseen participants of the workshop enjoy their coffee break outside, the scene unfolds against the backdrop of an invisible blanket of emotions that distribute in a non-uniform fashion across all those who are seen in this photograph; perhaps including the nervousness that embraces anyone who is about to give a talk on the one end for one, and the tired happiness of the days of teaching on the other end for another... At the forefront, we see Alex exuding the powerful yet anxious energy of someone who is preparing to explain something that has not been explained before to a room full of tired attendees. Right in front of Alex we see Mete, a co-conspirator of Alex, who is unable to contain his happiness over the fact that in just a few moments he will take his seat to leave Alex all by himself under the spot light. Then there is Tom, standing in front of the screen with his hands in his pocket, radiating the unmistakeable body language of the *carry on, I'm just passing by* people while laser focusing on the screen to decipher the entire content of the presentation just from its title slide. A true scientific inquirer with no patience. Florian's gaze is on his screen and his sternness parallels the one on Iva's face, who is also caught looking at her screen in the far diagonal corner of the frame. The focused demeanor shared by both is a testament to their ability to remain oblivious to the surrounding revelry. With a brief glance at this photograph, the fingers of punctum and studium points Iva and Florian as the *happencers* of this event, who carry the burden before, during, and after making things happen. How many times were they seen within this friendly room of warm wooden walls and people, engaging in silent technical battles either with the workshop agenda, the upcoming presentations, or the hands-on tutorials? Who knows. Yet, here they are once again. All these are happening before the overseeing glow of the screen that dominates the space with its undeniable presence and authority. Meren walks in. Captures this moment. And soon after, Alex gives a good talk.

The workshop was not the only thing that was happening this week as this opportunity was also a venue for the Early Career Researcher Symposium on Microbial 'Omics, which included a 5-minute flash talk by every participant over the course of five days between 13:00 and 14:00.

It was absolutely amazing to learn about so many exciting research questions and, every single participant did such an amazing job fitting everything into their talks so expertly, this experience did two things to me:

1. I never want to listen to a talk that is longer than 5 minutes .. EVER .. (ok I'm joking with this one a bit (but am I?)).
2. I never want to participate in a workshop where the attendees do not do this (this is 100% serious).

I would like to continue my unpopular takes that probably make me uninvited from all future events with the fact that I now also think that conferences where talks are longer than 5 minutes and only a fraction of people can truly introduce themselves and their work are a waste of time. I AM RESOLUTE.

# The Workshop Survey Results

Whenever we organize workshops, we remember our shortcomings in teaching as researchers with their own scientific priorities and boundaries. That said, we strive to make the best use of our and others' time during these events to support our community most effectively. So it is extremely critical for us to receive attendee feedback, insights, and suggestions to do better.

That's why the second half of the last day of the workshop we conducted an online survey to understand what worked well throughout the week, and what could be improved for future activities of similar nature. The survey was online and anonymous.

## General questions

- Anvi'o visualization tools helped participants understand genomics better, even without a formal background.  
- Participants valued the chance to experiment with their own ideas, such as generating custom *anviograms* using the anvi'o interactive interface features.  


### What would have made hands-on tutorials more useful for you?

Overall, participants seemed to have found the hands-on tutorials valuable but would benefit from more time, deeper integration across exercises, and additional support for troubleshooting and learning at their own pace. Here are some specific points that emerged from all the free-text:

**Strong Engagement and Appreciation**  

- Many participants highly valued the tutorials, praising them as well-documented, well-explained, and immersive.  
- Some even described them as the best bioinformatics tutorials they had attended, appreciating the detailed guidance.  
- Participants felt the tutorials provided a solid foundation for future use, helping them feel more confident in applying anvi'o to their own research.  

**Need for More Time & Independent Practice** 
 
- A common theme was the desire for more time to fully explore the tutorials, play around with the data, and reinforce understanding.  
- Some wished for more DIY-style challenges where they could independently work through problems before discussing solutions.  
- A few participants suggested setting aside dedicated time on the last days to work directly on their own data using what they had learned.  

**Challenges with Understanding & Pace**  

- Some beginners found it overwhelming, especially with bash/command-line usage.  
- Many suggested having an introductory session covering the most used commands and flags in anvi'o.  
- A few participants struggled to keep up with the pace, mentioning that sometimes the workshop moved too fast, leaving them unable to process everything.  
- Others noted that not having access to all necessary data at the start made it difficult to catch up if they fell behind.  

**Desire for More Integration Across Tutorials**

- Several participants wished for a tutorial series that simulated a full research workflow, where each tutorial builds on the previous one and integrates into a final, interpretable result.  
- Some suggested incorporating messier real-world datasets, instead of pre-cleaned examples, to better reflect actual research challenges.  
- There was also interest in exploring long-read data alongside the existing tutorials.  

**Enhancing Interactivity & Troubleshooting Support**  

- Many enjoyed the interactivity and found live Q&A with the anvi'o team invaluable.  
- Some wished for a dedicated troubleshooting session where they could address installation or system-specific issues without interrupting the main flow.  
- A few participants suggested sharing standardized terminal settings/environments to create a more uniform learning experience.  

**Suggestions for a More Balanced Schedule**  

- A few attendees felt the workshop was intense, making it difficult to absorb all the information.  
- One participant suggested ending the schedule earlier in the afternoon (e.g., 3pm latest) to improve retention and avoid fatigue.  


### Did you encounter any major technical difficulties during the workshop?

Most participants reported no major issues, but there were multiple issues brought up by multiple participants. Some of these issues are related to the fact that the new building of HIFMB is new, and this was the first workshop at this scale. Now we know better :)

**Internet Connectivity Issues** 

- Some participants had unstable Wi-Fi connections, with or without eduroam.  
- A few noted that frequent disconnections caused them to lose time during the workshop.  

**Slow Performance and Execution Delays**  

- Some commands took longer to run, making it difficult to keep up with the tutorial.  
- One participant reported that their shared computing cluster was overloaded, which affected command execution.  

**Installation & Environment Setup Challenges**  

- A few struggled with installing anvi'o from GitHub, possibly due to low storage space or system issues.  
- Some participants accidentally installed the wrong anvi'o version but were able to correct it with instructor support.  
- Conda environment conflicts caused issues, especially when switching between `zsh` and `bash`.  
- Some found it difficult to download required dependencies like NCBI-COGs, with interrupted downloads.  

**Errors Leading to Falling Behind**  

- Some participants spent too much time fixing errors and found it hard to catch up with the tutorial content.  
- A participant mentioned getting lost during the pangenome graphs tutorial due to the extensive troubleshooting.  

**Praise for Workshop Support**  

- Many attendees thanked the workshop team for being quick and effective at troubleshooting issues.  
- Several noted that pre-workshop email instructions were clear and helpful in preparing for the workshop.  

### Do you have any suggestions regarding how to increase instructor-participant or participant-participant interactions in the future?

Most participants seemed to have found the workshop already interactive and well-structured, but luckily for us, several helpful ideas emerged for further improving instructor-participant and participant-participant engagement :)

**Positive Feedback on Interactivity**  

- Many participants felt the workshop was already highly interactive and had no additional suggestions.  
- Several praised the friendly, open environment, saying they had not attended a more welcoming workshop.
