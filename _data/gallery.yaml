    description: "Sequence variants on predicted 3D structures with anvi'o. Though MAG-01 is abundant in both oceans, the Eastern Pacific and Western Atlantic differ dramatically in their geochemical and physical properties. One way to understand how the environment may shape genome evolution is to inspect gene-level variability profiles (e.g., codons or amino acids). The profile shown here indicates greater variability in the Eastern Pacific metagenome. Variable residues are then mapped onto the predicted structure of the resulting protein. Changes in amino acid sequence can alter the shape of a protein, and such changes may influence the protein's function."

    title: "Metapangenomics"
    description: "The metapangenome of Prochlorococcus. Each one of the 7,385 gene clusters contains one or more genes contributed by one or more isolate genomes. Bars in the first 31 layers indicate the occurrence of gene clusters in a given isolate genome. Gene clusters are organized based on their distribution across genomes (i.e., gene clusters that co-occur in the same group of isolates are closer to each other), and genomes are organized based on gene clusters they share using Euclidean distance and Ward ordination. The three next layers describe the gene clusters in which at least one gene was functionally annotated using Pfams, EggNOGs, or COGs. Another layer describes the ratio of environmental core versus environmental accessory genes (ECGs/EAGs) within each PC. Gray areas account for the genes in genomes undetected in the metagenomic dataset. Finally, the last layer corresponds to our selections of gene clusters. The 'HL + LL Core' selection corresponds to the gene clusters that contained genes from all genomes. The 'LL Core' and 'HL Core' selections correspond to clusters that contained genes characteristic of the LL- and HL-adapted genomes, respectively. The last selection ('Singletons') corresponds to clusters that contained one or multiple genes from a single genome. The right-hand side section of the figure provides additional data for each isolate. The bottom rectangle displays the relative distribution of genomes across 93 metagenomes and is followed by layers that show the average distribution of each isolate in the metagenomic dataset and the phylogenetic clades to which they belong. The dendrogram on the top represents the hierarchical clustering of genomes based on the occurrence of gene clusters."

The figure shows the presence–absence of 1,166 gene clusters in the pangenome of four Wolbachia metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and the reference genome wPip Pel. The gene clusters (i.e., groups of homologous genes based on amino acid sequence identity) are organized based on wPip Pel synteny. Each MAG is represented by two layers, where the first layer indicates the presence or absence of a gene cluster in a given MAG, and the other shows the average coverage of each Wolbachia MAG O07 gene cluster in the corresponding C. pipiens metagenome. The second-to-last layer shows whether genes in a given gene cluster have a match in NCBI's COGs. The outermost layer associates gene clusters with previously identified prophage regions in the wPip Pel genome. The number of gene clusters assigned to WOPip prophage regions are indicated in parentheses."
